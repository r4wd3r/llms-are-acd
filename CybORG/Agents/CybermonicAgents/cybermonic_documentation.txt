In order to train an agent please ensure you have downloaded the requirements, specifically the requirements under "#cybermonics." The file to train the agent is on /cage-4/cybermonic_documentation.py. This is the file in which you will train the agents in. Before training make sure you adjust the "training_episodes" length. For most optimal results the agents training should be around 50,000 training episodes. The command to train a new agent is python train.py [OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]. Optional flags are also available whihc are used to to configure the number of parameters used by the models hidden and embedding layers. In order to changed them use --hidden or --embedding to alter them, typically the defualt to hidden = 256 and embedding = 128. The trainin will create new folders called logs and checkpoints, in which the logs and the models weights of the agents will be saved in.
